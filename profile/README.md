_About BalancedWork: why and how we built what we did._

**BalancedWork** helped companies decide when they should be working in person, and why. Leaders have intuitions about the best ways for their teams to work together, but it is more complicated for hybrid teams -- and it's especially difficult in organizations with multiple teams and dvisions. 

The question of when to work in person has huge impacts on employees' work, and on their personal lives. _Why should we expect managers and teams to navigate hybrid work without any support?_ Our platform analyzed existing enterprise data to help leaders and teams make the best decision, at scale. 

We ingested calendars and org charts through enterprise APIs, analyzing each meeting for every person. For each interaction, we used AI to categorize the work happening based on meeting title and participant roles. We aggregated all interactions between meeting participants historically. We then made a recommendation about the ideal location of each meeting.

Working with small professional services firms and large real estate partners, we launched a web platform that displayed individual, team and organizational analyses. For individual employees, we generated emails recommending the best things to do on office days: reschedule a meeting to a call on a remote day; meet up with a colleague whom you haven't met in-person before.

In early 2025, amid broader economic shifts and continued "RTO" efforts, the founders decided to suspend further development. 

We'd be glad to discuss what we built with anyone who's interested. As far as we're aware, as of Q3 2025, BalancedWork is still the only tool to help organizations make normative judgments about the ideal location of interactive work.
